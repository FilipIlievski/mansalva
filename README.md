Design of an informal handwritten font 

![CarolScripp Intro](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carolinashort/CarolScripp/master/documentation/imgs/carolscripp%20purple%20text.png)

The aim of this project is to create a handwritten font that can be use for notes and informal text. 

It started as an experiment during idle time, and it turn out as a script with a good flow, so I've decided to develop the whole set. I always wanted to try FontSelf Maker as I think it's a tool students can use to create quick fonts and icons. So the beginning of this font was on FontSelf Maker with Adobe Illustrator. It's easy to use and I was surprised that provided many features as tracking and kerning tools. When the project was more advanced, I've decided to move onto Glyphs.
